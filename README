These are files that I used on my private git server.
You need to enable ssh server, install git-shell and modify git-shell-commands/baseurl so the hostname and port are set properly.

See
  http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server
and
  man git-shell
for a complete guide.
